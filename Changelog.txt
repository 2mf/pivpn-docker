and fixes a relaunch of the PiVPN installer.

#3) Aug 23rd, 2020:  PiVPN repo location fix
======================================================
The PiVPN repo location was incorrectly, causing errors to occur during the Docker 
image build on a Raspberry Pi.  Image otherwise built correctly on AMD64 machine.

#2) Aug 23rd, 2020: Minor fixes
======================================================
This commit fixes (not very) minor issues, such as PiVPN not launching with data from 
persistant storage.  Also removes warning message about pivpn user already exists during 
PiVPN install script.

#1) Aug 23rd, 2020: Refactor to use latest PiVPN
======================================================
This commit refactors this repo to use the latest PiVPN commit in building the docker image.

It also removes the seperate Dockerfile builds per architecture, seeking to use one Dockerfile
image to generate multiple architecture containers.

Documentation has been updated to add volume mount point information for persistant server and
client certificates, as well as DH parameter storage.  It is noted that certificates and parameters
are generated with first run of the container, as well as the need for persistant storage.
