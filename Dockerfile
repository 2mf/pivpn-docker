# Due to an unresolved bug in the Go archive/tar packageâ€™s
# handling of sparse files, attempting to create a user with
# a sufficiently large UID inside a Docker container can
# lead to disk exhaustion as /var/log/faillog in the
# container layer is filled with NUL (\0) characters.
# Passing the --no-log-init flag to useradd works around
# this issue.
